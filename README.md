ABOUT
Assessment 2 (Interactive Prototype 1) as part of the course DECO7230 - Digital Prototyping.

This project is the second of four total prototypes in the course digital prototyping at the University of Queensland.

Shit We're Having a Meltdown is a game set in the hectic situation of a nuclear power plant where two players have make compromises in 
order to reach their common goal of supplying the electrical demand whilst keeping the power plant from a nuclear meltdown.


HOW TO RUN
This project have to be run on localhosted dev server, as the code does not take into consideration a reset function of which will allow
several playthroughs.

This can be done by installing node.js and running the command 'node app.js' in the cmd.

You need to open up two browsers on localhost:3000 and have one select player one and the other player two. This should start the game.

P.S. In this version of the game there are some major async bugs that hinders normal gameplay which is to be fixed in the upcoming
prototype.
